# Weather

The script outputs to the console information about the weather for specific locations (at the moment it is: Sheremetyevo Airport, London, Cherepovets)

## Getting Started

Run the script and it will display the weather

### Python compatibility

Python3 should already be installed. Use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install python3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

This script is very easy to use, and all you need to do is just run the script in the console:

```
python3 get_weather.py
```

### Project Goals

This code was written for educational purposes as part of an online course for web developers at dvmn.org.
